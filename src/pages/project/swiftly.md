Taking inspiration from Spotify Wrapped and leveraging the Spotify API, this app allows users to create a unique individual soundtrack for them based on certain things about their day. The answers to the questions weight the outcome of the final playlist. The user also has the option to save the playlist to their Spotify account & share it with friends.

I chose React for this project simply because I wanted to learn React. Years ago, I did an original version of this idea with PHP and Angular, it was a frankenstein project where I didn't really understand how either PHP or javascript worked. It was extremely satisfying rebuilding this project with better skill and knowledge into something I'm now proud of.
