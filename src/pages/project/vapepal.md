Vapepal is an online eliquid store. They came to me with the brief for their flagship online store to build them an ecommerce site. The site was already designed so it was down to me to build the store.

The client already knew they wanted to use Wordpress & Woocommerce for the site and I already had a lot of experience with both of those platforms due to a previous job role. I built the store a while ago now so it utilises Jquery which was standard at the time. It also uses the foundation css framework.

This build required a lot of bespoke, complex requirements, including a very complex automated product discount algorithm and a custom Worldpay integration.
