​​I wanted to learn Svelte and I had an idea to build a simple app that allows you to calculate how much music you can listen to on Spotify based on either the amount of data you have or the amount of time you want to listen for.

The app takes into account your listening quality and performs 1 of 2 calculations; how much data you need to listen for a certain amount of time, or how much time you can listen for based on an amount of data.

The app uses Svelte 3 so in time I will upgrade to 4. I also chose to use Vite over SvelteKit because at the time SvelteKit wasn't very stable.

Currently not quite finished, however on my list to get finished any time soon!
