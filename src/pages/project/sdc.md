​​I wanted to learn Svelte and I had an idea to build a simple PWA that allows you to calculate how much music you can listen to on Spotify based on either the amount of data you have or the amount of time you want to listen for.

Being a PWA, it allows the user to save the app to their homescreen as well as use the app offline once they have saved it.

The app takes into account your listening quality and performs 1 of 2 calculations; how much data you need to listen for a certain amount of time, or how much time you can listen for based on an amount of data.
