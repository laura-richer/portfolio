Bear Fired Fodder are a mobile wood fired pizza business who provide amazing pizza for special events, weddings & private parties.

They came to me after a simple website to allow potential bookings to get more of an idea of what they can expect in terms of menu and setup.

I chose a stack of Astro & open source CMS Sanity for this build, keeping the design and build really minimal and simple. The client wanted a CMS driven platform so they could update their menu on the fly without any further input from me and Sanity seemed like the right choice for the job, lightweight, self hosted & customisable. Astro seemed like the perfect frontend framework, being super lightweight and shipping no javascript, I wouldn't need to worry about any SSR to accommodate this simple 1 page build. Everything renders straight to the DOM.

This was my first Astro build, and I have to say, I love it. For small simple projects it seems like the obvious choice. I'm yet to use it to build anything bigger than this portfolio but Im keen to try it out on a larger project for sure.
