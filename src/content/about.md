Hey, I'm a self taught, passionate frontend developer currently residing in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Currently working for a digital agency in Leeds city center, I get to work on all sorts of amazing, varied projects. We predominantly use Vue for our builds, Vite for our build compiler, Strapi & Graphql for CMS & data providing. At this agency I've also had experience with Nuxt, Angular, Rest API, Webpack and Drupal.

I've built this site mostly as a bit of a playground, I tend to rebuild it every time I want to learn a new technology just to give the learning a bit of purpose. But it also serves as a platform to showcase some of the projects I work on in my own time.

I am always interested in taking on freelance work so if you have an idea for a project give me an email or call for a chat!
